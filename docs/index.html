<p>Hi, my name is Gil and I like to learn things. Among all the things i've learned, I've discovered that those which stuck the best were those that involved <strong>doing</strong>, rather then <strong>reading</strong> or <strong>hearing</strong>.
This website/blog/whatever is dedicated to sharing interesting learning experiences me (or my friends) had. The theme however, is "Learning by Doing". Therefore each story is arranged like a mini-course, where the main emphasis is on the exercises.</p>
<h1>Stories</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="/stories/nuclear_energy/part1/">Nuclear Energy Sustainability</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/stories/transfer_matrices/part1/">Transfer Matrices 1</a></p>
